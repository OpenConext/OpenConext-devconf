Feature: A RAA manages ra candidates in the ra environment
  In order to promote candidates
  As a RAA
  I must be able to promote and demote identities

  Scenario: Provision a institution and a user to promote later on by an authorized institution
    Given institution "institution-a.example.com" can "select_raa" from institution "institution-a.example.com"
    And institution "institution-b.example.com" can "select_raa" from institution "institution-a.example.com"
    And institution "institution-d.example.com" can "select_raa" from institution "institution-a.example.com"
    And a user "jane-a-ra" identified by "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a-ra" from institution "institution-a.example.com"
    And a user "jane-a1" identified by "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a1" from institution "institution-a.example.com"
    # The two users below are only used to create institutions for the SRAA switcher
    And a user "user-b1" identified by "urn:collab:person:institution-b.example.com:user-b1" from institution "institution-b.example.com"
    And a user "user-b2" identified by "urn:collab:person:institution-d.example.com:user-b2" from institution "institution-d.example.com"
    And the user "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a-ra" has a vetted "yubikey" with identifier "00000001"
    And the user "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a-ra" has the role "raa" for institution "institution-a.example.com"
    And the user "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a-ra" has the role "raa" for institution "institution-b.example.com"
    And the user "urn:collab:person:institution-a.example.com:jane-a-ra" has the role "raa" for institution "institution-d.example.com"

  Scenario: SRAA user checks if "Jane Toppan" is a candidate for all institutions (without filtering)
    Given I am logged in into the ra portal as "admin" with a "yubikey" token
    When I visit the RA promotion page
    Then I should see the following candidates:
      | name                                  | institution               |
      | jane-a-ra                             | institution-a.example.com |
      | jane-b1 institution-b.example.com     | institution-b.example.com |
      | user-b-ra institution-b.example.com   | institution-b.example.com |
      | user-b5 institution-b.example.com     | institution-b.example.com |
      | Admin                                 | dev.openconext.local      |
      | SRAA2                                 | dev.openconext.local      |

  Scenario: SRAA user checks if "Jane Toppan" is a candidate for all institutions (with filtering on institution-a)
    Given I am logged in into the ra portal as "admin" with a "yubikey" token
    When I visit the RA promotion page
    Then I should see the following candidates for "institution-a.example.com":
      | name                              | institution               |
      | jane-a-ra                         | institution-a.example.com |


  Scenario: SRAA user checks if "Jane Toppan" is a candidate for all institutions (with filtering on institution-b)
    Given I am logged in into the ra portal as "admin" with a "yubikey" token
    When I visit the RA promotion page
    Then I should see the following candidates for "institution-b.example.com":
      | name                                | institution               |

      | user-b-ra institution-b.example.com | institution-b.example.com |
      | user-b5 institution-b.example.com   | institution-b.example.com |

  Scenario: SRAA user demotes "jane-a-ra" to no longer be an RAA for "institution-a"
    Given I am logged in into the ra portal as "admin" with a "yubikey" token
    When I visit the RA Management page
    Then I relieve "jane-a-ra" from "institution-a.example.com" of his "RAA" role

  Scenario: SRAA user checks if "Jane Toppan" is a candidate for "institution-a"

      | user-b-ra institution-b.example.com | institution-b.example.com |
      | user-b5 institution-b.example.com   | institution-b.example.com |
